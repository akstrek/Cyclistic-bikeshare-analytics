# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analytics

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis project. The project explores bike-share ride data from Cyclistic, a bike-share program in Chicago, between July 2022 and June 2023. The analysis covers various aspects, including user behavior, ride patterns, A/B testing and time series forecasting using SARIMA.


## Data Exploration

The project begins with an exploration of the dataset, detailing the meaning of each column and providing an overview of the data's structure.

Here is the detailed overview of the [data set](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps are described, including date and time conversion, duration calculation, distance calculation and additional data cleanup.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section provides insights into user behavior, user type distribution, rides by day of the week and hour of the day, distribution of rides over time, average trip duration and distance, rides by ride type, top routes, most active start stations and a station location heatmap.

## A/B Testing

The A/B testing section outlines the hypothesis, experimental design, sample size calculation, significance level and p-value calculation. It concludes with the interpretation and implications of the test results.

## Time Series Analysis with SARIMA

This section provides a step-by-step explanation of the time series analysis using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. It covers data preparation, visualization, stationarity testing, differencing, seasonal decomposition, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis, grid search for hyperparameter optimization, model fitting, forecasting and model evaluation.

## Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the key findings and insights from the analysis. The interactive dashboard can be found within the project directory.

## Potential Strategies

Several potential strategies are suggested based on the analysis findings, including priority access for annual members, trip duration limits, gamification, partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, expanding the electric bike fleet, seasonal promotions and station optimization.

## Project Structure

The project structure is outlined, explaining the organization of files and directories within this repository.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use and reproduce the analysis and dashboard are provided for interested users.
